# VideogamesMuseum
Project presented during my high school graduation thesis. An interactive museum designed using tools such as SketchUp Make and Blender and animated through Unity3d. The museum is made up of various rooms with models of old game consoles and old cabinets inside. Some cabinets are playable, since through Unity2D I have implemented 3 games such as PONG, Space Invaders, Pac-Man. It is possible to move inside the museum through the controls of an FPS.
You can try the project executing Tesina.exe.
I load on GitHub only the scripts of the various 2d games, the loading view scripts and some scripts useful for the museum rooms.
